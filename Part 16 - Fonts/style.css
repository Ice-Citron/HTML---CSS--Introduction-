    /* Comment regarding the code here

        @font-face { ... }: This rule allows you to define a custom font called "SixtyFour" that isn't available by default in web browsers. It 
        tells the browser how to load the font.

        font-family: "SixtyFour";: Declares a name for the custom font, which you can then use in other CSS rules to apply this font to text.

        src: url(Sixtyfour/Sixtyfour-Regular-VariableFont_BLED\,SCAN.ttf);: Specifies the path to the font file. This path is relative to the 
        location of the CSS file. The backslash (\) before the comma is used to escape the comma in the filename, which might otherwise be 
        misinterpreted by CSS. However, typically, filenames on the web avoid such characters to prevent encoding issues.

         thin text appears, but its effect might depend on the font being used and whether it supports different weights.
        font-style: italic;: Makes the text italic. This property slants the text to the right, giving it an italicized appearance.
