<!-- Notes regarding the first 3 lines

    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    This line suggests to the browser that it should start establishing a connection to the Google Fonts server (https://fonts.googleapis.com) in 
    anticipation of making requests. This can help speed up the loading process because the connection is established earlier.

    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    Similarly, this line initiates an early connection to another Google server that hosts font files (https://fonts.gstatic.com). The crossorigin 
    attribute is used because the resources being fetched (in this case, fonts) are on a different origin than the originating site, and it ensures 
    the browser handles these cross-origin requests properly, including the use of proper headers and security measures.

    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Honk&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    This line actually imports the font into your webpage. It does this by linking to a CSS file provided by Google Fonts which contains the 
    necessary @font-face rules to include and use the font named "Honk" in your website. The display=swap part of the URL tells the browser that 
    it can display text using a fallback system font until the requested font has finished loading, at which point the browser swaps the text to 
    the requested font. This helps improve the perceived load time of the text on your webpage.

    By including these lines in the <head> section of your HTML document, you're telling the browser to fetch and use the "Honk" font from Google 
    Fonts, allowing you to use it anywhere on your webpage by referencing it in your CSS.
